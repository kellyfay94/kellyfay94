Howdy!

I'm Kelly Christopher Fay (@kellyfay94).

I'm a software engineer that mostly works in backend apps, but have done a little frontend work, too.

I've worked in Go, TypeScript, Ruby, Python, and C#, but I'm always looking for new languages and projects.

For now, my personal repository will contain just a few things that I reference myself and can share.

Let me know if you have any questions!
